# Project: Task Tracker with Time Tracking and Reporting

## Overview: I need a small web application that helps me manage my daily tasks and tracks the time spent on each one. The app should allow me to:

* Create tasks (with titles, descriptions, and deadlines).
* Start and stop a timer for each task.
* View a report at the end of the day or week that shows how much time I spent on each task.

This project will allow you to demonstrate front-end skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), some back-end skills (if you want to use Node.js or another backend), and the ability to create a clean, functional UI.

## Features:
1. Task Management
Add a Task: Users can create a task with a title, optional description, and due date.
Example: "Write documentation for project", "Complete code review for John"
Task List: The task list should display the current tasks in progress or pending. Each task should have:
Title
Description
Status (Pending, In Progress, Completed)
Total Time Tracked (if time has been tracked)
2. Time Tracking
Start/Stop Timer: Each task should have the ability to start and stop a timer that tracks the time spent on that task. When the user clicks “Start Timer,” the timer should begin and stop when they click “Stop Timer.” It should keep track of the total time spent on the task and store that data.
Example:
Task: "Write documentation", Time: 1hr 30min
Task: "Complete code review", Time: 45min
3. Daily/Weekly Report
Report: At the end of the day (or week), users should be able to generate a report that summarizes:
Total time spent on each task.
Tasks completed.
Any tasks that are overdue or still pending.
4. Basic User Authentication (Optional but nice to have)
Allow users to sign up, log in, and have their tasks persist between sessions.
This can be simple (email and password), and for the purpose of this project, you can use local storage or a lightweight backend like Firebase or Node.js with MongoDB.
5. Responsive Design
The application should be mobile-friendly, so users can track tasks from their phone as well as their desktop.





# Technical Requirements

## Front-End:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Core technologies for building the interface.
React (optional): If you're comfortable with or want to learn React, it could make the project more modular and future-proof.
CSS Framework (Optional): You can use frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS to make the UI more polished, but you should also try writing your own styles to learn CSS fundamentals.

## Back-End (Optional):
Node.js with Express: If you're comfortable, you could build a small backend to store tasks in a database (e.g., MongoDB or PostgreSQL). Otherwise, you could start with local storage or Firebase for simplicity.
API Integration: If you're building a back-end, you could create an API that allows for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on tasks.

## Version Control:
Use Git for version control, and host the project on GitHub (or GitLab). Commit your changes incrementally to show a progression of the project.
Suggested Steps to Build the Project:
Plan the User Interface (UI):

Wireframe the design to get a clear idea of the layout (header, task list, buttons, timer).
Create a simple and intuitive UI.


## Set Up Your Development Environment:

### Set up a Git repository.
Create the project structure: HTML, CSS, JS files (or React components if using React).
Build the Task Management System:

### Create the ability to add tasks with basic validation (title is required, for example).
Display tasks in a list format.
Implement task status updates (Pending, In Progress, Completed).
Implement Time Tracking:

### Create start and stop buttons for each task.
Use setInterval (JavaScript timer) to track the time when the timer is running.
Save the time to local storage (or backend if you implement it).
Generate the Report:

### At the end of the day or week, create a report page or modal that summarizes all tasks and the time spent on each.
(Optional) Implement Authentication:

### Add simple login functionality if you want to learn about user authentication. You could use Firebase Auth for simplicity or build a basic Node.js authentication system.


## Test and Polish:

### Make sure the app works on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
Add small animations or interactions to make it feel smooth (e.g., highlight tasks when they are being timed).
Deploy:

### Deploy the application using a service like Netlify, Vercel, or Heroku.
Share the GitHub repository with your work and write a README.md that explains the project.




## Polishing
- [ ] Add a little clock emoji before the title of the app.
- [ ] Make (probably rounded) button shapes for the buttons of "Track Time" and "Reports"
